My name is Cao Yu and I have just completed my postgraduate degree in Computational Finance at UCL. The topic of my dissertation is deep learning on unbalanced datasets datasets. My interests are in data mining and deep learning, making intuitive and beautiful charts to visualise complex data.

I am currently looking for a job as a data analyst within London, UK, and I am also applying for a PHD related to deep learning.
