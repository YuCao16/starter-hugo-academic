## Research Question and Aim
The prediction of whether a customer will default on a loan is a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore both dealing with missing values in the data and data imbalances, as well as comparing various machine learning methods.

## Conclusion
By adding weights to the algorithms we tested the limits of the two machine learning methods. By weighting the methods it is possible to achieve a 100% recall for both algorithms, albeit at the cost of accuracy. But for the prediction of loan defaults, such a trade-off is mostly worthwhile. And of the two algorithms, weighted logistic regression is the more impressive performer, yielded higher recall rate and AUC in both cases.
